# Mirroring

This little project is about making a simple automated mirror image from a target *dir* to a wished destination *dir*. This will be made with **rsync**. 

It's not about making a incremental backup systems but only to sync a set of data to a wished location. So we have a backup from the current set of data. (If it's about making a incremental backup you could look after **borgbackup**.)
